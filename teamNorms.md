Daily process


** Rules for code **
- at least 2 tests per ticket
- commits should be full detailed sentences in present tense
- commit often, as soon as something works


**Rules for communication **
- inform of pull requests and updates to master via slack
- clearly communicate, vote on disagreements
- daily standup leader rotates if it's not AJ

**Rules for work schedule **
- expect all team members to be here at 9:30 and stay until 6
- working later depends on pairs / progress ---open discussion
- primarily pair-programming
- daily stand-up in the am, quick post-lunch check-in meeting


** Also this: ***

Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels (to other teammates, another 15 for AJ)
Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take 10-15 minute break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
Take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
